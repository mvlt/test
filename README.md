# &#402;
> A JavaScript Component Framework

## Helps you build large, modular apps.
With nested components, view showing and rendering, easy REST integration, and dead simple inheritance.

## Doesn't reinvent the wheel.
Using [Backbone], [Handlebars], [Underscore], and [jQuery], &#402; provides a simple way to modularize large applications.

## Stays (pseudo) classy.
F uses [PseudoClass], an OOP framework that lets you create building blocks that you can extend, mixin, and re-use.
